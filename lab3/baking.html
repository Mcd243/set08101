            <p>Tip in the flour, soured cream, eggs, vanilla and ¼ tsp salt to the bowl and mix again until you have a smooth consistency. Pour into your lined cake tin, scraping out every last bit of cheesecake mixture. Give the tin a sharp bang on the worktop to remove any air bubbles, then bake for 30 mins.</p>

            <h3>Recipe tips: On the side</h3>
            <p>ROASTED APRICOTS Cut some apricots in half, toss with a little honey and a splash of Vin Santo or Spanish sherry for a boozy kick and roast at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 15 mins.</p>
            <p>MACERATED BERRIES Steep some strawberries and raspberries in a little sugar and lemon juice. The acidity helps balance out the rich cheesecake.</p>
