            <p> Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/ gas 9 ensuring plenty of space above the middle shelf. Butter a deep 20cm, loose-bottom or springform cake tin. Lay two large sheets of baking parchment, one on top of the other, one sheet turned 45 degrees, so the corners point in different directions. Push the parchment into the tin, pressing into the corners and making sure plenty of paper is sticking out above the rim. Press the creases up the sides, but don’t worry about lining the tin too neatly – the grooves in the parchment give this cheesecake its characteristic look.

            <h3>Recipe tips: On the side</h3>
            <p>ROASTED APRICOTS Cut some apricots in half, toss with a little honey and a splash of Vin Santo or Spanish sherry for a boozy kick and roast at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 15 mins.</p>
            <p>MACERATED BERRIES Steep some strawberries and raspberries in a little sugar and lemon juice. The acidity helps balance out the rich cheesecake.</p>
