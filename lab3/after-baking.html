            <p>Once cooked, the cheesecake should be deeply caramelised on the outside and puffed up like a soufflé. It will still have a wobble when you shake the tin. Leave it to cool completely in the tin – it will sink as it cools. Chill for at least 1 hr before serving. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</p>

            <h3>Recipe tips: On the side</h3>
            <p>ROASTED APRICOTS Cut some apricots in half, toss with a little honey and a splash of Vin Santo or Spanish sherry for a boozy kick and roast at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 15 mins.</p>
            <p>MACERATED BERRIES Steep some strawberries and raspberries in a little sugar and lemon juice. The acidity helps balance out the rich cheesecake.</p>
