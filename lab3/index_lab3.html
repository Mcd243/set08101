            <p>
            When baking a cheesecake , it is important not to over bake it . You only want to
            bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle , not until it is rock solid .
            </p >
            <p > It is important that you use a water bath , discussed at the right , to ensure
            even baking of your cheesecake . </p >
            <aside>
            To create a water bath , use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water
            that
            goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed .
