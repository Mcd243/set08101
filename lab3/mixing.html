            <p>Tip the soft cheese and sugar into a large bowl or a stand mixer. Beat together using an electric whisk (or stand mixer) for a minute or 2, until the grains of sugar have dissolved – check this by rubbing a little of the mixture between your fingertips. If it feels grainy, keep mixing for another minute or so.</p >

            <h3>Recipe tips: On the side</h3>
            <p>ROASTED APRICOTS Cut some apricots in half, toss with a little honey and a splash of Vin Santo or Spanish sherry for a boozy kick and roast at 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 15 mins.</p>
            <p>MACERATED BERRIES Steep some strawberries and raspberries in a little sugar and lemon juice. The acidity helps balance out the rich cheesecake.</p>
